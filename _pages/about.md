My research fields focus on bio-inspired robotics, a discipline at the edge between robotics and animal behavior. Our robots can be considered as artefacts to better understand animals.

In this interdisciplinary framework, we take our inspiration from animals like flies, ants or bees to develop new technologies or new strategies for autonomous robots. We also try to go back to biology by proposing new hypotheses or new experiments to better understand the sensorimotor reflexes at work in our biological models.

My research can be organized as a triptych: Perception, Processing and Locomotion. In these three fields, I have various research projects that cover a broad range of scientific field: from the study of vertical perception in flies, to the ant-based navigation based on polarized skylight, through the development of resilient robots with multimodal locomotion and the development of innovative contactless interfaces for gesture recognition.
